# Insight_Data_Challenges

These jupyter notebooks and presentations were created for data challenges during the Insight Data Science Fellowship program. The data challenges listed below were all completed within a 4-hour time window.

## Recipe2Cuisine

You've just joined the data team at an online publishing company. One of your verticals
is a food publication. A product manager on your team wants to build a feature for this
vertical that enables users to query by cuisine, not just by ingredients. Most of your
recipes are unlabeled, and it's infeasible to label them by hand. Luckily, you have a
small training set of about 10,000 recipes with labeled cuisines.

Design and execute a method to predict the cuisine of a recipe given only its
ingredients. How could you design this to be robust enough to understand similarities /
substitutions between ingredients? For each each major cuisine, what are the driving
ingredients that characterize it?

Your product manager indicates a likelihood that you will only need to write a guideline
for an outsourced team to hand label the remaining corpus. How would you go about
writing this guide for a few major cuisines?


## Happy Hotel

You've just joined the data team at a large hotelling chain. Your specific team is
embedded in the CX (customer experience) division. Each day you receive hundreds of
reviews of your 10 hotels from your customers. Each review consists of a free-form text
review and a report of "happy" or "not happy". A product manager on your team wants
to understand each hotel's performance at a more granular level; they want to build a
product to identify topics within reviews. All of your reviews are unlabeled, and it's
infeasible to label them by hand.

Design and execute a method to identify topics within the reviews. For each topic, find a
robust means of assigning a score to each hotel in that topic. For each of the ten hotels,
what recommendations would you make to their general managers?


## Costly Conversion

You sit inside the product team at Symantec, which sells a cyber security software for $39 across a variety of devices. Revenue has been flat for some time, so the VP of Product would like to experiment with the effect of increasing the price. Your team designed an experiment to measure the effect of doing so. In the experiment, 66% of the users have seen the old price ($39), while a random sample of 33% users were shown a higher price ($59).

The experiment has been running for some time and the VP of Product is interested in understanding how it went. She would like to learn key insights about what drives conversion rate. She'd like a recommendation of what price to sell the software at, and for you to quantify the cost of the experiment and whether you could have done it in shorter time. Would you have designed the experiment differently, why or why not?
